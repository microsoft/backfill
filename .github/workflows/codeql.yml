# This is the same as the default setup as of writing. It appeared necessary to create this file
# because the default CodeQL job stopped triggering on PRs after the master/main rename.
# That might have been a temporary blip, so if desired, you can try updating repo settings to
# switch back to the default CodeQL job and see if triggers for PRs (and if so, delete this file).
